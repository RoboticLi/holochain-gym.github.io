# Requirements >> Anatomy || 40

The [`developer-exercises`](https://github.com/holochain-gym/developer-exercises) repository contains exercises for each of the lessons presented here in the Gym.

The repository itself is a cargo workspace. Each of the exercises consists of two separate cratesâ€”one for the exercise itself and another for the solution to the exercise.

It is also an NPM workspace, since we are using tryorama for the tests.

## Anatomy of an exercise

Each exercise has two folders:
* exercise
* solution

The solution folder contains a complete and working version of the exercise folder. After you solve the exercise you can compare your solution with our solution. Or, if you are really lost, you can take a quick look...

The structure inside the exercise and solution folder are very similar to a real holochain application. So let us review what you see when you open the entries exercise.


``` 
  > 1.entries
      > exercise
          > tests
          > workdir
          > zomes
          README.md
          ...
      > solution
```

The best place to start if you are lost is to read the **README** file again. It briefly states what you need to do to compile and test the exercise.

The heart of the exercise lies in **zomes/exercise**. This is a pure and simple Rust project and contains its own `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` file. You start adding Rust code in `src/lib.rs`

Once you are done adding code you need to compile your Rust code to a [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) binary and package it in a DNA, a holochain specific format. The result will be stored in **workdir**.

To make your life easy we put together a npm script in the `tests/package.json` that checks if you are running in the nix-shell and builds the code. To build your zome you only need to run **npm run build** inside the `tests` folder.

The **tests** folder contains a full node/typescript project, complete with `package.json`,`tsconfig.json` and a `src` folder. These tests can be viewed as integration tests. They actually run your compiled DNA in a real holochain [conductor](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/glossary/#conductor). The tests call your code, just like a regular web app would do.

For running the tests we also provided another npm script that checks if you are running in the nix-shell and runs the tests. You only need to call **npm test** inside the `tests` folder.

Now you know enough to start the [first exercise](/developers/basic/entries/) or you could start by exploring the main [concepts](/concepts/) of holochain in a hands-on way. Except for a few minor differences, the holochain-gym exercises look and act just like real holochain app projects.
If you want to start working on your own holochain apps, separate from the holochain-gym, you can read the next section.

## Building your own Holochain app (optional)

If you want to familiarize yourself with a sample Holochain project, clone the [Holochain DNA Build Tutorial](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-dna-build-tutorial).

- Look at the folder structure:
  - `zomes` contains various zomes (holochain modules), each zome is a normal rust crate.
  - `workdir` contains important Holochain files, defining your DNAs and hApp.
  - `tests` contains the tests for the DNA.
  - `default.nix`: this file is really important, as it defines which holochain binaries should be used with this happ. *Difference with holochain-gym*: In the gym we placed this file at the root of the repository, so you can work on all exercises in the same terminal.
- Enter the `nix-shell` for this repository by running `nix-shell .` in the root folder.
- Compile the DNA with:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
hc dna pack workdir/dna
hc app pack workdir/happ
```

*Difference with holochain-gym*: In the gym we provide a simple build script `run_build.sh` that checks you are running inside a nix-shell and if so, runs the above steps.

- After compiling, run the tests with:

```bash
cd tests
npm install
npm test
```

*Difference with holochain-gym*: In the gym we provide a simple test script `run_tests.sh` that checks you are running inside a nix-shell and if so, runs tests.

You can look at the files of the project, and also play around with all the various commands that `hc sandbox` offers.
